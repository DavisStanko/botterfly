# Discord-Bot

Botterfly is currently not maintained and is no longer available for public use. Discord's API is ever changing and I don't have the time to keep up with it. If you would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to fork it and make a pull request.

## History

This project was originally created in 2018 as a way to learn Python and as such it was made with `Discord.py`. I have since rewritten it in `Discord.js` due to it's more active development and better documentation.
